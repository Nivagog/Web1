                <p>Melbourne (/ˈmɛlbərn/ (About this sound listen) MEL-bərn)[8][9] is the state capital of Victoria and the
                    second-most populous city in Australia and Oceania.[1] The name "Melbourne" covers an urban agglomeration
                    spanning 9,992.5 km2 (3,858.1 sq mi),[2] which comprises the broader metropolitan area, as well as being
                    the common name for its city centre. The metropolis is located on the large natural bay of Port Phillip
                    and expands into the hinterlands towards the Dandenong and Macedon mountain ranges, Mornington Peninsula
                    and Yarra Valley. Melbourne consists of 31 municipalities.[10] It has a population of 4,725,316 as of
                    2016[1], approximately 19% of the national population, and its inhabitants are called Melburnians.[11][12]
                    Founded by free settlers from the British Crown colony of Van Diemen's Land on 30 August 1835, in what
                    was then the colony of New South Wales,[13] it was incorporated as a Crown settlement in 1837.[13] It
                    was named "Melbourne" by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Richard Bourke, in honour of the British
                    Prime Minister of the day, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne.[13] It was officially declared a city
                    by Queen Victoria, to whom Lord Melbourne was close, in 1847,[14] after which it became the capital of
                    the newly founded colony of Victoria in 1851.[14] During the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s, it was
                    transformed into one of the world's largest and wealthiest cities.[15] After the federation of Australia
                    in 1901, it served as the nation's interim seat of government until 1927.[16] Additionally, it was the
                    host city of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Because Melbourne rates highly
                    in education, entertainment, health care, research and development, tourism and sport,[17] the EIU (Economist
                    Intelligence Unit) consistently ranks it the world's most liveable city.[18] It is a leading financial
                    centre in the Asia-Pacific region, and ranks among the top 15 cities in the world in the Global Financial
                    Centres Index.[19] Referred to as Australia's "cultural capital",[20] it is the birthplace of Australian
                    impressionism, Australian rules football, the Australian film and television industries, and Australian
                    contemporary dance. It is recognised as a UNESCO City of Literature and a major centre for street art,
                    music and theatre. It is home to many of Australia's largest and oldest cultural institutions such as
                    the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria, the State Library of Victoria and the
                    UNESCO World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. The main passenger airport serving the metropolis
                    and the state is Melbourne Airport (also called Tullamarine Airport), the second busiest in Australia.
                    The Port of Melbourne is Australia's busiest seaport for containerised and general cargo.[21] Melbourne
                    has an extensive transport network. The main metropolitan train terminus is Flinders Street station,
                    and the main regional train and coach terminus is Southern Cross station. Melbourne is also home to Australia's
                    most extensive freeway network and has the world's largest urban tram network.[22
